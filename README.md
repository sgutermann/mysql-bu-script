# mysql-bu-script
This is something that I still have running on a few servers. 
I obviously had some extra time in 2015 as you can tell on some
of the ASCII art in the script. Sorry for that.

All you need to know is that this is the copy I found somewhere on
my drive and I labeled everything as Alpha as I did not test it in 
a new unit of time. If you are really planning on using it, give it a spin
and let me know if something is not working out for you.

I have enough comments in the scripts to guide you through my thoughts
so it should not be too hard to follow along if you need to debug something.

## how to use

Simply copy both file to your server. Run the prepare_mysql_backup.sh and
answer all the questions.

Done.
